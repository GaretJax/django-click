``django-click`` is a library to easily write Django management commands using the
``click`` command line library.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation for the Click command line library: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/
* Compatible with Django 4.2 and 5.0 running on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 (note: 3.10+ required for Django 5.0).


Installation
============

::

  pip install django-click


Example
=======

Create a command module as you would usually do, but instead of creating a
class, just put a ``djclick`` command into
``<yourapp>/management/commands/helloworld.py``:

.. code:: python

   import djclick as click

   @click.command()
   @click.argument('name')
   def command(name):
       click.secho('Hello, {}'.format(name), fg='red')

And then call the command with::

   $ ./manage.py helloworld django-click
   Hello, django-click
